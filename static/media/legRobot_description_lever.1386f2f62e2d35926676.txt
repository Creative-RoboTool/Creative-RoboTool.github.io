You are a quadrupedal robot on the ground. There is a surfboard, a chair, a heavy cube, and a yoga_roller. The surfboard is leaning against a chair. The chair is supporting the surfboard at one end. The yoga_roller is directly under the surfboard and lying on the ground. The yoga_roller is not touching the surfboard. The heavy cube is affixed to the surfboard'end that is on the ground. The goal is to make the heavy cube off the ground. 

Numerical scene information:
  The position is represented by a 3D vector [x, y, z]. The axes are perpendicular to each other. z axis is perpendicular to the ground surface and pointing upwards.
  yoga_roller's center is at position [1.0, 0.4, 0.075] with size [0.34, 0.15, 0.15]. The yoga_roller is not movable.
  surfboard's center is at position [1.0, 0.4, 0.3] with board size [0.55, 1.1, 0.07]. The surfboard is of weight 0.2kg. You can walk on the surfboard. The surfboard is much lighter than the box.
  chair's center is at position [1.0, 0.0, 0.3] with size [0.3, 0.3, 0.6]. The chair is movable.
  cube's center is at position[1.0, 0.6, 0.1] with size [0.2, 0.2, 0.2]. The cube is really heavy and is of weight 10kg.
  quadrupedal robot's center is at position [0.0, 0.0, 0.515] with size [0.5, 0.5, 0.35]. The quadrupedal robot is of weight 10kg.

Constraints you must follow:
 - You do not have a lift skill and cannot directly lift the box.
 - You can only push an object with a weight smaller than 5kg.
 - You can push the chair only in the x-direction.
