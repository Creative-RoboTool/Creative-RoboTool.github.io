This part is to calculate the 3D target position of the gripper.

Common Rules:
* Calculate step by step and show the calculation process between <start of description> and <end of description>.
* Return the 3D position between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
* You must not assume any position and directly query the updated position of the objects.
* You must only query the object name provided in object list when using 'get_center' and 'get_graspable_point'.
* The "open_gripper" and "close_gripper" do not need target positions. Return a space character between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
* To bring an [OBJECT] into the workspace, the 3D target position should be [0.0, 0.0, object_size[2]/2].

Rule 1:
<Current Step>: Use the 'move_to_position' skill to move the [OBJECT1] to [OBJECT2].
Answer: 
<start of description>
* The [OBJECT1] is in hand. The target position should be the center of the [OBJECT2].
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [OBJECT2]'s center position.
<end of answer>
Rule 2:
<Current Step>: Use the 'move_to_position' skill to push the [OBJECT] into the workspace.
Answer: 
<start of description>
To push an [OBJECT] into the workspace, the 3D target position should be [0.0, 0.0, object_size[2]/2].
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [0.0, 0.0, object_size[2]/2].
<end of answer>

In the following, you will see the plan and must follow the rules.
