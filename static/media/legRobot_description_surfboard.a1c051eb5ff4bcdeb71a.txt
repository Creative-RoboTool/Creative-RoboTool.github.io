You are a quadrupedal robot on top of sofa_1. Your x-y position is [-0.5, 0.0]. There is another sofa_2 in front of sofa_1. There is a surfboard and a strip_of_cloth on sofa_1. Object list = ['sofa_1', 'sofa_2', 'surfboard', 'strip_of_cloth']. You want to stand on top of sofa_2.

Numerical scene information:
* Each objects' center is represented by a 3D vector [x, y, z]. The axes are perpendicular to each other. z axis is perpendicular to the ground surface and pointing upwards.
* Each object occupies a bounding box with size represented as <size>: [length, width, height].
* [sofa_1]: <center>: [0.0, 0.0, 0.17]; <size>: [1.5, 0.9, 0.34]; <movable>: False.
* [sofa_2]: <center>: [1.45, 0.0, 0.17]; <size>: [0.6, 0.9, 0.34]; <movable>: False.
* [surfboard]: <center>: [0.50, 0.0, 0.375]; <size>: [1.1, 0.55, 0.07]; <movable>: True.
* [strip_of_cloth]: <center>: [0.3, 0.2, 0.342]; <size>: [1.1, 0.55, 0.004]; <movable>: True.
