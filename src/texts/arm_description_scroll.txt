You are in a 3D world. You are a robot arm mounted on a table. You can control the end effector's position and gripper. Object list = ['can', 'stick', 'strip_of_paper']. You want to grasp the can.

Numerical scene information:
- The position is represented by a 3D vector [x, y, z]. The axes are perpendicular to each other.
- The base of the robot arm is at [0.0, 0.0, 0.0].
- [strip_of_paper]: <center>: [0.6, 0.2, 0.05]; <size>: [0.6, 0.4, 0.06]; <graspable point>: [0.3, 0.2, 0.05]. 
- [stick]: <center>: [0.6, -0.1, 0.02]; <size>: [0.5, 0.02, 0.02]; <graspable point>: [0.4, -0.1, 0.0]. 
- [can]: <center>: [0.7, -0.03, 0.07]; <size>: [0.08, 0.05, 0.05]; <graspable point>: [0.7, -0.03, 0.065].
