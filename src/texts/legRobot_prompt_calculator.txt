This part is to calculate the 3D target positions.

Common Rules:
* Calculate step by step and show the calculation process between <start of description> and <end of description>.
* Return the 3D position between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
* You must not assume any position and directly query the updated position of the objects.
* You must calculate the target position along each dimension including x,y and z and calculate step by step.
* The "get_position" and "get_size" do not need target positions. Return a space character between <start of answer> and <end of answer>.
* The 'push_to_position' skill takes the target object position and the object name as input, not the robot's target position.
* The 'walk_to_position' skill takes the target 3D position as input. Note that the z position does not matter since the skill itself will handle the climbing. You can fill in 0 for the z position.
* When calculating the target position for the 'push_to_position' skill, you must consider the spatial relationship between the objects. For instances, the target position of [OBJECT1] may be dependent on the position of [OBJECT2] and [OBJECT3].

Example 1: 
<Current Step>: Use the "push_to_position" to push 'box' to the middle of object_1 and object_2 in x-axis.
<start of description>
* The target position can be computed by using values obtained by "get_position" from the last step. 
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [(object_1_pos[0] + object_2_pos[0])/2, object_2_pos[1], object_2_pos[2]].
<end of answer>

Example 2: 
<Current Step>: Use the "push_to_position" to push object_1 next to object_2.
<start of description>
* Since object_3 is occupying the adjacent positive x direction of object_2, we can only push object_1 to the negative x direction of the object_2. The target position along the x-axis is object_2_pos[0] - object_2_size[0]/2 - object_1_size[0]/2.
<end of description>
<start of answer>
The 3D target position is [object_2_pos[0] - object_2_size[0]/2 - object_1_size[0]/2, object_2_pos[1], object_1_pos[2]].
<end of answer>

In the following, you will see the plan and must follow the rules.
